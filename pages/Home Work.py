st.markdown("## Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)")
st.text("In the context of Python and OOP, polymorphism refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same interface. It allows a single function, method, or operator to work on different types (classes) of data.")

st.markdown("1.Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)")
st.markdown("- This occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of         a method that is already defined in its superclass.")
st.markdown("- The method signature remains the same, but the behavior changes in the derived class.")

st.markdown("2.Method Overloading (Not Native in Python)")
st.markdown("- Unlike Java or C++, Python does not support traditional method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters).")
st.markdown("- However, we can achieve similar behavior using default arguments or variable-length arguments.")

st.markdown("3.Operator Overloading")

st.markdown("- Python allows operators like +, -, , etc., to be overloaded usingdunder (double underscore) methods*.")
st.markdown("- This means we can define custom behaviors for operators when applied to objects of user-defined classes.")

st.markdown("4. Duck Typing (Subtype Polymorphism)")
st.markdown("- Python is dynamically typed, meaning it does not require explicit interfaces or base classes.")
st.markdown("- If an object implements a required method, it can be used in place of another, following the principle 'If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, treat it as a duck.'")

st.markdown("### Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Python OOP that helps in writing clean, scalable, and maintainable cod")

st.success("Why is Polymorphism Important? \n 1. Code Reusability: Same function name can be used for different types, reducing redundancy. \n 2. Scalability: New classes can be added with minimal changes to existing code. \n 3. Flexibility: Functions and methods can handle different object types dynamically. \n\n\n Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Python OOP that helps in writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code.")
